This project orignally formed part of the boot.dev lesson: "Build Asteroids using Python and Pygame".

Since then, I have been adding and upgrading the game beyond the original scope of the lesson.

Uses of current branches:
Original Game - v1.0-release
Work In Progress - Development
Tested Uprades - Main
